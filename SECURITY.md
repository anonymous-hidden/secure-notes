## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of potential vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process
**DO NOT** post security details publicly in issue trackers, forums, or social media.

**DO** send a detailed private report including:
- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant logs or error messages (sanitized of sensitive data)
- Affected versions and configurations

### Contact Information
üìß **Primary Contact**: anonymous-hide-me-pls@proton.me
üîí **PGP Key**: Available upon request for encrypted communication

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Security Patch**: Critical issues addressed within 7 days

### Vulnerability Classifications
- **Critical**: Authentication bypass, encryption vulnerabilities, remote code execution
- **High**: Privilege escalation, data exposure, session hijacking
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, denial of service
- **Low**: Configuration issues, minor information leaks

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Account Security
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use 12+ character passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
2. **Enable 2FA**: Always activate Two-Factor Authentication for enhanced security
3. **Backup Codes**: Store 2FA backup codes securely and separately from your device
4. **Password Changes**: Update passwords if breach warnings appear
5. **Unique Passwords**: Never reuse your SecureNotes password elsewhere

### Operational Security
1. **Secure Environment**: Run on trusted, updated systems with current antivirus
2. **Physical Security**: Always lock the application when stepping away
3. **Shared Devices**: Never use SecureNotes on untrusted or public computers
4. **Regular Updates**: Install security patches and updates promptly
5. **Backup Management**: Secure your encrypted backups with strong physical security

### Advanced Security (v2.0)
1. **Session Management**: Configure appropriate timeout values for your environment
2. **Security Monitoring**: Regularly review security event logs
3. **Threat Awareness**: Monitor security notifications and alerts
4. **Compliance Settings**: Configure data retention according to organizational policies
5. **HSM Usage**: Utilize Hardware Security Modules in enterprise environments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations (v2.0)

### Inherent Limitations
- **Password Recovery**: Lost passwords cannot recover encrypted data (by design for security)
- **Physical Access**: Device access could expose encrypted files (unreadable without keys)
- **Memory Residue**: Some sensitive data may remain in system memory on certain platforms
- **Screen Capture**: GUI content not protected from screen capture malware
- **Swap Files**: Encrypted data might be written to swap partitions

### Mitigation Recommendations
- **Full Disk Encryption**: Use BitLocker, FileVault, or LUKS on the host system
- **Disable Swap**: Turn off virtual memory or use encrypted swap partitions
- **Secure Boot**: Enable secure boot and UEFI protections
- **Endpoint Protection**: Use enterprise-grade anti-malware solutions
- **Network Isolation**: Consider running in air-gapped environments for maximum security
