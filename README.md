Encrypted Notes App is a secure personal notebook built with Python and Tkinter that keeps your information private using end-to-end Fernet (AES) encryption. Each user has their own password-protected account, and all notes are stored as encrypted files on your deviceâ€”never sent anywhere online. The app features a simple, modern interface with dark and light themes, auto-save, password change with re-encryption, and secure account deletion. Designed for privacy and ease of use, it ensures your data stays fully encrypted at all times while providing a smooth note-taking experience.
